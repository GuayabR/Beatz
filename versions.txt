Customizable settings allow you to change multiple keybinds for different actions in the game!
Game starts up with the default settings, which are:
Notes:
Note left: A, Note up: W, Note down: S, Note right: D.

Song controlling:
Previous song: Q, Restart song: R, Randomize song: T, Next song: E.

Other:
Toggle Auto Hit: 1, Toggle note style (Arrows or circles): C.

Reworked file loading, files now auto-load on startup, drastically reducing lag.
Added fullscreen keybinds and a changeable default note style (arrows/circles)

Added device handling, since Beatz.io is only supported on PC, if you try to start up the game on a mobile device, it will run, but you aren't able to hit any notes, which makes the game pointless.
//

1.9.1 (6/06/2024)
